# Final-project
We are buliding an RPG game 
In this game, you have mainly these functions for adventuring:
1)	Battle
We have already help you set the difficulty of this game to a good level, so don’t worry about the balance of the game.
There are almost 20 maps in this game. When you go to entrances and exits we will transfer you to the correlation map automatically. There are even some second level maps like some buildings waiting you to explore. 
You can set whether or not to meet an enemy by the setting. Make sure to switch this button off when your HP is too low.
The chance that you meet an enemy is 1/12 by step.
You can escape when you believe the chance to win is too low.
There are many skills you can master. With the upgrade of your level, your skill will be unlocked. Different skills may be suitable for different levels.
One interesting thing is that when both your and your enemies’ HP are negative, you and they still have chance to do the last fight. This skill is very powerful and will cause more damage. 
There are 5 bosses in the game. Their levels have negative relationship with the time that you might meet them. The final goal is to beat boss 5 in the tower and save the world!!!
2)	Shopping
You can buy 2 things in shop that is represented by a red icon. They are “Potion of Life” (Red) and “Crystal of Power” (Blue) which help recovers your HP and MP.
You need money to buy these two stuffs. The gold can be earned in two following ways:
1.	Pick up from the treasure in the maps.
2.	Be rewarded when winning a battle
3)	Walking
Yeah! You have the feeling of being a virtual world and have freedom to explore and appreciate the cute plants and architectures.
4)	P.S
When you don’t know which icon represents what, just use the helper in the game
